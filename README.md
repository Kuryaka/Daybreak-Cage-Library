Kuryaka Cage Library

Compatible with all known standard-sized flywheels on the market and "standard" 130-180 size brushed motors. AKA everything from stock wheels to Daybreak/Eclipse. 

Minimum print settings: 3+ walls, 1mm+ roofs and floors. 0.3mm layer height. Print motor-side-down (default arrangement) with supports.
My preferred print settings: 2mm walls (5 walls), 1.6mm roofs and floors, 0.2mm layer height. Support roofs enabled in Cura with 0.4mm Z gap for easy removal. 

Please contact me at kurymakesthings@gmail.com or on Discord (Kuryaka #0932) in the BAFT or /r/Nerf servers (or wherever you happen to find me!) if you have questions or source file requests. 

Major Changelog: 
v3: Teardrop shaped dart tunnel for printability, wider flywheel clearance. Chamfers instead of fillets to reduce filesize. 
v4: Tighter motor wells to be in line with Pulsar cages. Improved teardrop. STEP export will be included going forward.
