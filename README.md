# Kuryaka-Cage-Library
Kuryaka Cage Library

v3.1 of Kuryaka-style cages. Compatible with all known standard-sized flywheels on the market and "standard" 130-180 size brushed motors. AKA everything from stock wheels to Daybreak/Eclipse. 

Minimum print settings: 3+ walls, 1mm+ roofs and floors. 0.3mm layer height. Print motor-side-down (default arrangement) with supports.
My preferred print settings: 2mm walls (5 walls), 1.6mm roofs and floors, 0.2mm layer height. Support roofs enabled in Cura with 0.4mm Z gap for easy removal.
